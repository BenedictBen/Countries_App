## My process

After reading and analyzing the design specifications, I focused on getting all the essentials working, like the API, routing, and parsing the JSON data. From there, I worked on file structure to make the components reusable and easier to maintain.  And finally, there were several rounds of component coding, styling, and refactoring.

### Built with

- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/core/guides/quick-start)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is a great React single-page application that interfaces with the REST Countries API. While I have written several React applications from scratch, this was the first one that used React Router and an API. It provided a great opportunity to manage the information from the API and control the navigation between pages.

During this project, my knowledge of Tailwind CSS grew, and I incorporated its styling effects into the project. Initially, I struggled with coding the dark mode functionality, but I was very happy when I finally accomplished it. Additionally, this project is one of the various projects where I incorporated CSS Grid in Tailwind CSS, and I was extremely pleased with the results.
